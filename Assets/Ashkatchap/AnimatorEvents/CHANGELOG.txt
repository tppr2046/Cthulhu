v2.5.5
- Fix "On State Enter, Transition Start",  "On State Enter, Transition End" and  "On State Exit, Transition Start" were firing if there was also an extra condition that evaluated to false at the moment they should fire and later became true.
- Added advanced conditions "On/Enter transition starts", "On/Enter transition ends" and "On/Exit transition starts"

v2.5.4
- Fix scrubbing an animation of type BlendTree throws warnings because at least one of the parameters that drives it is controlled by a curve.
- Added BeforeEtc... condition versions to all the AfterEtc... existing ones (e.g. After Normalized Time => Before Normalized Time).
- PDF manual instead of a .txt one.

v2.5.3
- Fix setting an action to change a float or int parameter with an operation (instead of using the mode replace), then changing the parameter used by the action to one of type bool or trigger, doesn't update the mode to replace.

v2.5.2
- Added static bool EventSMB.AllConditionsEvaluateToFalse to temporarily force conditions to be evaluated to false.
- Fix condition OnNormalizedTimePerLoop in the case the state has looping disabled.
- Added condition "After/Normalized time per loop".

v2.5.1

v2.4.9
- Fix inline events on EventSMB not showing correctly in the editor, making it impossible to use them.
